Repository Information:

`code`:

 +  `R`: R scripts used to generate figures and perform statistical analyses (specifically t-tests on the frequencies of empathy terms)
    
 +  `Python`: Jupyter notebooks (used in Google Colab) used for the subsetting of the data, W2V, t-SNE plotting, and dataset summary statistics.

`figures`: A folder (all_tsne_plots) containing all 547 t-SNE plots for every year. Naming is as follows: *top_20_**EMPATHY.TERM**_**CBOW/SG**_**YEAR**.png*. Also contains the figures used in the presentation (frequency of empathy terms over time, frequency of standardized empathy terms over time, all p.value heatmaps (from two sample t-tests).

`tables`: Contains all relevant tables, including empathy term frequencies and dataset summary statistics. As a note: the original dataset was not included here due to the privacy issues.
